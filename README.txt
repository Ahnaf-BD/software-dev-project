#Prerequisities

Tests are run using the JUnit 4 framework. Please ensure that JUnit 4 is installed on your system. If it is not installed,
download the JUnit 4 jar file from the JUnit website. The jar file should be installed in the lib directory of the project
along with the hamcrest-core jar file.

#Testing

For the CardGameTest, for lines 19 and 40, change the path to 'mockPack.txt' to whatever it is in your system; 
Similarly, for line 33, change the path to 'invalidPackSize.txt' to whatever it is in your own system and then you can run it
